# CarbonWatch Kenya — Community Tracker

A single platform for carbon credit transparency and community empowerment in Northern Kenya conservancies.

## The three layers

- **Community Interface** — SMS + IVR (offline-first, power-aware). Receives and sends information; closes the loop with reference IDs and status checks. *If you don’t close the loop, you’re extracting data, not empowering people.*

- **SCOUT Engine** — Translation between lived experience and governance. Maps SMS/IVR inputs to WEAI-style empowerment dimensions and governance signals. **Rule:** no indicator enters the dashboard unless it came from the community layer first (avoids elite capture). Outputs: community-level indices, red flags, action prompts.

- **Public Dashboard** — Accountability weapon for regulators, buyers, NGOs, journalists, funders. Exposes carbon credit lifecycle, buyer identity, benefit-sharing flows, community voice metrics, and education/response log.

## End goal

*Our end goal is transparency: communities want to be involved and learn about carbon credit funds and decision-making, but current methods are absent.* Bidirectional communication is the foundation that enables future social objectives.
